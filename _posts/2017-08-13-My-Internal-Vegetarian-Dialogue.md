“Dang it’s really hard to be vegetarian at Twitch”

“So stop complaining and eat more meat. It tastes so gooood”

“🤔 ok”

--

“Hey, I’m having second thoughts about meat, after Andy sent us his summary of Animal Liberation.”

“But look at how good we’re doing! Still in shape and saving so much money by not eating out!”

“True. Though I’m intrigued by the speciesism argument, which sounds pretty radical.”

“How’s that go?”

“Let’s just read the book.”

--

“Omg gross I don’t want to eat meat ever again those descriptions were awful”

“Yea, the living conditions are tiny and disgusting. I bet any person who reads Animal Liberation would give up meat for at least a day. RIP chicken feet, never again.”

--

“Those ribs look good.”

“Remember speciesism? We’d never eat dogs, right? Why is eating pig okay?”

“Pigs are dirty and brutish, and dogs are cute.”

“Even if that were true, which you know it isn’t, pigs still suffer, just as much as a dog.”

“If we don’t eat it, it’s just gonna go to waste!”

“Being vegetarian is a boycott. Boycotts reduce future production by reducing present consumption.”

“I doubt these catering companies are keeping tabs.”

--

“I don’t think our stomach is doing well without meat.”

“Just takes time to calibrate. Let’s get some probiotic pills to help speed up the process.”

“Yogurt and kombucha not good enough?”

“Apparently you lose a lot of the benefit before it makes it to the intestine, and pills protect the bacteria till then.”

--

“Dude you’re super judgy about literally everyone who eats meat. Can you just like chill?”

“But it’s cruel! And bad for the environment!”

“And we were eating it every day only 3 months ago, so you know, we’re not perfect either. I get that you have to feel strongly about it to maintain your resolve, but it’s pretty toxic, and it rubs off.”

--

“K so we’re spending an extra $200-300 a month to be vegetarian, can we give our wallet a rest?”

“Sure. Meat every so often is fine. We don’t have to be fully vegetarian.”

“YUSSSSS”
