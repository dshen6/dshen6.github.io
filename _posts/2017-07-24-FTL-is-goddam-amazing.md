Hell yes this game is fucking awesome. Okay so here's what I love about it:

The decisions you make carry tremendous weight. Deciding to hire one alien species over another will impact your interactions with future space travelers, since alien crew members give you different options in dealing with threats. You are rewarded appropriately and it's so gratifying. SECRET RACE OMG

Losing people is not fun, but not irrecoverable. How gritty. You can keep fighting the good fight, cause that's what he/she/it would have wanted.

One bad thing:

You're in space, exploring the vast universe, diving into hostile territory with unknown dangers. Every new game puts you in different situations. But in the last few stages, you tend to prepare exclusively for the final boss because it's exactly the same everytime.
