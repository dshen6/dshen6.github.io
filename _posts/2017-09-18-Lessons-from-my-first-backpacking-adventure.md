Lessons learned, in chronological order

1) Check your compass periodically, especially right when you start. We missed a turn early on and walked a mile the wrong direction.

2) Adjust your backpack straps periodically to spread out weight on different areas of your body.

3) Stretch early on, after you are warmed up.

4) Prehydrate! 3L of water a day is a good benchmark.

5) Soupy meals are filling, easy to clean up, and comforting. They keep you hydrated too.

6) Napkins are a luxury.

7) It gets dark and cold real quick, you don’t want to have to brush teeth/bio when it’s dark.

8) When brushing, spit out foam half-way through so you’re not drooling everywhere.

9) Night vision is awesome, preserve it when possible.

10)Consider investing in an inflatable chair mat, rocks are hard.

11)Overestimate on toilet paper.
