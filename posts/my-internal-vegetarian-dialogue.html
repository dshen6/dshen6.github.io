            <p>“Dang it’s really hard to be vegetarian at Twitch”</p>

<p>“So stop complaining and eat more meat. It tastes so gooood”</p>

<p>“🤔 ok”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m having second thoughts about meat, after Andy sent us his summary of Animal Liberation.”</p>

<p>“But look at how good we’re doing! Still in shape and saving so much money by not eating out!”</p>

<p>“True. Though I’m intrigued by the speciesism argument, which sounds pretty radical.”</p>

<p>“How’s that go?”</p>

<p>“Let’s just read the book.”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Omg gross I don’t want to eat meat ever again those descriptions were awful”</p>

<p>“Yea, the living conditions are tiny and disgusting. I bet any person who reads Animal Liberation would give up meat for at least a day. RIP chicken feet, never again.”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Those ribs look good.”</p>

<p>“Remember speciesism? We’d never eat dogs, right? Why is eating pig okay?”</p>

<p>“Pigs are dirty and brutish, and dogs are cute.”</p>

<p>“Even if that were true, which you know it isn’t, pigs still suffer, just as much as a dog.”</p>

<p>“If we don’t eat it, it’s just gonna go to waste!”</p>

<p>“Being vegetarian is a boycott. Boycotts reduce future production by reducing present consumption.”</p>

<p>“I doubt these catering companies are keeping tabs.”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“I don’t think our stomach is doing well without meat.”</p>

<p>“Just takes time to calibrate. Let’s get some probiotic pills to help speed up the process.”</p>

<p>“Yogurt and kombucha not good enough?”</p>

<p>“Apparently you lose a lot of the benefit before it makes it to the intestine, and pills protect the bacteria till then.”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Dude you’re super judgy about literally everyone who eats meat. Can you just like chill?”</p>

<p>“But it’s cruel! And bad for the environment!”</p>

<p>“And we were eating it every day only 3 months ago, so you know, we’re not perfect either. I get that you have to feel strongly about it to maintain your resolve, but it’s pretty toxic, and it rubs off.”</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“K so we’re spending an extra $200-300 a month to be vegetarian, can we give our wallet a rest?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Meat every so often is fine. We don’t have to be fully vegetarian.”</p>

<p>“YUSSSSS”</p>
